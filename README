Looking through the examples in Vim, there are examples of correcting typos and misspellings like:

iabbrev teh the
iabbrev het the
...

However, it is very time-consuming to create this list by hand.  You also have to enter the correct capitalization, which is a pain.  ('teh->the' is not equal to 'Teh->The')

It seems silly for everyone to create their own autocorrect file, so hopefully we can work together to make a sweet list.  I found a nice list from Wikipedia and cleaned it up a bit as a basis, and incorporated the typo fixes from Vim Cream.  I also added some words that I commonly misspelled or mistyped, and have taken additional contributions from users of the script.

I'm sure there are some mistakes, or common mistakes that aren't in here yet, so if you find any, please contact me and I will gladly change things.  There are some additional details or thoughts as well as a shortcut to a word-processing mode at http://22ideastreet.com/blog/2008/11/06/vim-word-processing.

I find this script invaluable when using Mozex to edit forms online (blog posts, web mail, etc.)

There is a GitHub repository that you can contribute to at http://github.com/panozzaj/vim-autocorrect/tree/master
